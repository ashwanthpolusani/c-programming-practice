# C Programming Repository: A Comprehensive Collection of Foundational Examples

This repository serves as a meticulously organized collection of C programming examples, designed to illustrate and reinforce fundamental programming concepts. Each program is a focused demonstration of core principles, making this an ideal resource for learning, reference, and review.

The primary objective of this project is to provide a clear and accessible set of examples covering a wide range of topics essential for any C programmer. The structure is designed for intuitive navigation, allowing users to quickly locate code snippets related to specific concepts.

## Project Structure

The code is organized into folders based on the programming topic. Each folder contains the source code (`.c` files) for the respective assignments.
```
.
├── 1D/                    # Programs for 1D arrays (searching, sorting)
├── 2d/                    # Programs for 2D arrays (matrices)
├── command_line_args/     # Programs using command-line arguments
├── Dynamic_meomory_allocation/  # Dynamic memory allocation programs
├── files/                 # File handling programs
├── pointers/              # Programs demonstrating pointer concepts
├── preprocessor_directives/ # Programs using preprocessor directives
├── strings/               # String manipulation programs
└── Structures_and_Unions/ # Programs for structures and unions
```


## How to Compile and Run the Code

To compile and run any of the programs in this repository, you'll need a C compiler like **GCC**.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a specific program's directory**:
    For example, to compile `search.c`:
    ```bash
    cd 1D/
    ```

3.  **Compile the source code**:
    Use the GCC compiler to create an executable file.
    ```bash
    gcc search.c -o search
    ```

4.  **Run the executable**:
    ```bash
    ./search
    ```
